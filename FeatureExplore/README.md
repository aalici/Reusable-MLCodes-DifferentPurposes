## FeatureExplore
* Best practice usage of exploratory data analysis splitted into 2 parts and highly recommended to use both of them before all your machine learning modelling works.
  * **Pandas Profiling:** Automatically extracts all table statistics, univariate feature analysis and some type of correlations. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application so you can easily observe all stuff. (https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/pages/introduction.html)
  
  * **Sweetviz:** The best data exploration tool to observe input and output(dependent variable) relations. It is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with just two lines of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application. (https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/)

* My individually written FeatureExplore file just includes some basic feature exploration boiler-plate codes that save your time to re-write then again and again.
